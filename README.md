## Contributors

Some amazing folks have helped build this app that you see today.

- [Juliane Lehmann](https://github.com/strooooke) for the amazing German translation 🇩🇪 

## Running Locally

```sh
# clone the project and cd into it
git clone https://github.com/smashappz/ezecbt_os && cd ./ezecbt_os

# install dependencies
yarn

# start development environment
sh run

# reset the cache if you're having problems
sh reset
```


# Can I help?
