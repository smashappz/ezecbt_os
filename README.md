## Contributors

Some amazing folks have helped build this app that you see today.

- ... for the amazing German translation 🇩🇪 

## Running Locally

ezeCBT is built on React Native and therefore assumes you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) is preferred over NPM as a package manager.

```sh
# clone the project and cd into it
git clone https://github.com/smashappz/ezecbt_os && cd ./ezecbt_os

# install dependencies
yarn

# start development environment
sh run

# reset the cache if you're having problems
sh reset
```


# Can I help?

Of course!

**If you like the app,** go give it 5 stars! It helps more people find the app.

**If you're a mental health professional,** audit [the descriptions](https://github.com/smashappz/ezecbt_os/blob/master/src/Locales/en.json) of the cognitive distortions. If you have suggestions, let me know and we'll change stuff!

**If you know a language other than English,** help [us translate the app!](/TRANSLATIONS.md)
